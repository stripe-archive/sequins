Sequins is a key/value database for serving static batch data.

It's well-suited to making data generated by Hadoop available to processes that
need low-latency, reliable access.

It's designed to be:

 - Horizontally scalable: replicate a hot dataset over a few nodes, or partition
   a large one over many.
 - Reliable: serve your data without an online dependency on Hadoop or HDFS.
   Sequins is built to be resilient to multi-node failures.
 - Interoperable: load data from HDFS or S3 in Hadoop's SequenceFile format.
   Tools like Spark or Impala can also be used to generate data.
 - Accessible: fetch values with HTTP GET; no client library required.
